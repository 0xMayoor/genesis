# GENESIS Project Initialization

Use this workflow when starting any work session on the GENESIS project.

## Steps

1. **Read the project vision**
   - Open and review `/home/kali/code/PROJECT_VISION.md`
   - Understand the 5-level architecture
   - Note the zero-hallucination requirements

2. **Check project rules**
   - Review `/home/kali/code/.windsurf/rules.md`
   - Ensure you understand the testing requirements
   - Note the documentation standards

3. **Review current status**
   - Check `/home/kali/code/docs/STATUS.md` if it exists
   - Look for any `BLOCKED` or `IN_PROGRESS` items
   - Identify what needs attention

4. **Understand the current focus**
   - Which level is being worked on?
   - What are the immediate goals?
   - Are there any blockers?

5. **Confirm readiness**
   - State what you understand the current task to be
   - Ask for clarification if anything is unclear
   - Propose your approach before implementing

## Key Reminders

- **Test first** — Always write tests before implementation
- **Verify everything** — Use deterministic tools, not assumptions
- **Document decisions** — Future AI teammates need context
- **Small increments** — Working checkpoints over big changes
- **Refuse when uncertain** — "I don't know" is valid
