# ADR-001: Project Codename GENESIS

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a project codename that reflects the nature of this work — building an AI coding agent from the ground up, starting from the most fundamental level (machine code) and progressively building upward.

## Decision
The project will be called **GENESIS**.

## Rationale
- "Genesis" means "origin" or "beginning"
- Reflects the bottom-up approach (starting from the beginning)
- Implies creation of something new
- Short, memorable, easy to reference

## Consequences
- All documentation will reference "GENESIS"
- Directory structures may use "genesis" as root name
- Future branding/naming should align with this theme
